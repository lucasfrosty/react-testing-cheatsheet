# React testing cheatsheet
This a personal unit test cheatsheet using [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/), [Jest](https://facebook.github.io/jest/) and [Enzyme](http://airbnb.io/enzyme).  

I'm using [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app), so i will skip the Jest instalatation, because that's already installed by default. I use yarn instead of npm, so use the [Migrating from npm to yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/migrating-from-npm/) compare table to get the equivalent command.


# Installation
To install, run the following command (for React >= 15.5):
```
yarn add enzyme react-test-renderer --dev
```
